Description: Analysis of results from multiplex ddPCR targeting several spots on the genome in order to assess its integrity. A first module permits to recover the PCR amplification probability per target from ddPCR on fully integer sequences. A second module recovers the proportion of each possible continuous sequence type from the results of ddPCR.
